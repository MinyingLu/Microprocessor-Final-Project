Use variable sos to keep track of the state of the system between WDT interupts.

	When 0 <= sos <= 5: LED1 blinks with 1 unit time interval 
	When sos = 6: LED 1 is off for 3 time units (break between groups of flashes)
	When 7 <= sos <= 11: LED1 flashes with 3 units on 1 units off (long flashes)
	When sos = 12: LED1 takes the second break of 3 units
	When 13 <= sos <= 17: LED1 blinks with 1 unit time interval 
	When sos = 18: LED1 is off for 7 units (break between messages)
Use LED1 (P1.0OUT) to blink

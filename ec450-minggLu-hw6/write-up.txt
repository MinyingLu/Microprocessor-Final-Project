Pull from adc example and spi example from course website.
because master is transmitting and slave is receiving. 
We connected port 1.7 to 1.7 on both launchpads, because it's in MOSI mode. 

In master.c
-----------------------------------
referring to the ADC example from course website
I used a potentiometer to manage the analog signal input 
use the adc_handler to convert analog signal to digital signal
save the converted signal to data_to_send variable. 
and in wdt_handler I send data_to_send to the UBC0TXBUF buffer.
Additionally, when I do that I shifted data_to_send by two bits
to get a more stable output for the slave. 
The signal will be transmitted to the slave through port 1.7 
through SPI. 
We also connect port 1.5 from master to port 1.5 to slave
-----------------------------------

In slave.c
-----------------------------------
We take advantage from the spi example from course website
but only using the receive part of the code. 
We also uses the knowledge from our last homework,
so the speaker will play different frequency when receiving 
different signal from the master. 
In slave.c we set the UCMST to zero, 
for the slave to be driven by master's clock.

Niko saved the signal from UCB0RXBUF to data_received variable
and pass the value into TA0CCR0 to change the output of the speaker
(he also did some math to make sure the frequency is within a reasonable range)
-----------------------------------

virtues: We are able to demonstrate a very obvious relationship between the slave and master. 
limitations: 
We used some math to optimize the code, instead of using clock cycles and other more "microcontroller-ish" solution
The slave can't talk back to master, it can only listen, but I think that's because we uses 3 pin implementation.

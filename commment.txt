# Team34

Well, not a good proposal for your project which I have to say. The proposal is too short and it makes me think that you may not put too much thought into it. Your project is not very complicate( it is too similar to HW5). And the components you need should be all you descript. What's worse, you chose a bad name which is very unlucky for every programmer.
